July, 2021. [Latitude Gallery, Brooklyn](https://latitudegalleryny.com/blogs/exhibitons/lingxiao-eyes-of-dragonfly). 「蜻蜓之眼 <span>(Eyes of Dragonfly)</span>」- A solo exhibition of poetry. 

> <span>The exhibition is a collection of poetry written by Chinese artist and poet LingXiao upon his arrival in New York. It is a record of his past experience clashing with new visions gifted from the City of New York. There are diaries, documentaries, or simply flashes, but all were sensitively curated because everything was never experienced.</span> <br><br> <span>The exhibition takes two parts: the poems and the illustrations. The illustrations which are made from LingXiao’s poems accordingly tries to express abstract concepts as something sensual. Even if someone does not read, the symbols could give an impression. And the illustrations form an eccentric writing system, which has 26 alphabets and absorbs some grammar from American Sign Language. Words are punctuated using colors, and hieroglyphics are used for abbreviation. They present poetry text as visual - if we agree a poem is a puzzle itself, the illustrations create an extra layer of puzzle over the poem.</span>
