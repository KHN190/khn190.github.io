	Archive for past and now.

I am an ex software engineer started from 2025. I worked in industry since 2017, while now a digital artist mainly working on a personal project in a remote Mexico village **El Potrero**, down in **San Luis Potosi**. I've made a few videos for personal recording, with a photo gallery on site, where you can view the videos here.

It is near an abandoned Spanish era silver mining town **[Real de Catorce](https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d58457.14986827569!2d-100.87628799999999!3d23.691264!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x8680b38b6edf55df%3A0x42020ea827b2cc8c!2zUmVhbCBkZSBDYXRvcmNlLCDlnKPot6_mmJPmlq_ms6LmiZjopb8!5e0!3m2!1szh-CN!2smx!4v1746397771318!5m2!1szh-CN!2smx)**, where you navigate through a lot of ruins in mountains. Tornados, cactuses, horses, deserts, peace and hearts among people are all there it has. 

I recreate the ghost town through 3D scans, sound recordings, poems and puzzles driven by an image classification AI. It brings audiences to different places by asking questions and reading your drawings.

The desert is sacred to [Huicol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huichol) people, which has been elevated as an UNESCO cultural heritage in 2025, for the presence of Peyote cactus and being the place for hosting hikuri pilgrimage. I lived in a friend's house Casa de Pirules, which has been built by him by hand since 17 years ago.
