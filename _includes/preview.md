	Archive for past and now.

I was an ex software engineer since 2017 and now a digital artist mainly working on a personal project, in a remote Mexico village **El Potrero**, down in **San Luis Potosi**. I've made a few videos for personal recording, with photos, where you can view at -

It is near an abandoned Spanish era silver mining town **Real de Catorce**, where you navigate through a lot of ruins in mountains. Tornados, cactuses, horses, deserts, peace and hearts among people. The desert is sacred to local Huicol people, for the presence of Peyote cactus and being the place for hosting __hikuri pilgrimage__. I live in a friend's house Casa de Pirules, which has been built by him since 17 years ago.
