<p>Back sometime, when I wandered in the cyber space I found a post about <a href="https://80.lv/articles/building-intricate-ice-shaders/">creating intricate ice in Unity</a>, and I immediately fell in love with the visual patterns. There is an incredibly beautiful image for you to have a feel:</p>

<p>However when I bought the asset to see how it worked, I was slightly unsatisfied because most of the patterns are baked in textures. The ices are not actually usable for arbitrary materials except for ground. And they are not transparent.</p>

<ol>
  <li>it can reflect lights</li>
  <li>it can refract other objects</li>
  <li>it has to be transparent</li>
</ol>
