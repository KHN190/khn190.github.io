<p>Back sometime, when I wandered in the cyber space I found a post about <a href="https://80.lv/articles/building-intricate-ice-shaders/">creating intricate ice in Unity</a>, and I immediately fell in love with the visual patterns. There is an incredibly beautiful image for you to have a feel:</p>

<p>However when I bought the asset to see how it works, I was slightly unsatisfied because most of the patterns are baked in textures. The ices are not actually usable for arbitrary objects except for plane. And they are not transparent. I clearly want a toy with similar breath but has the following traits:</p>

<ol>
  <li>it can reflect lights</li>
  <li>it can refract other objects through it</li>
  <li>it has to be transparent</li>
</ol>

<p>And after some research, I had this as my result - which is also the same you will have after the tutorial:</p>
