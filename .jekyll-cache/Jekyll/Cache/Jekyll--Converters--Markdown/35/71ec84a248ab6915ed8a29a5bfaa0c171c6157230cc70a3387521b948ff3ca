<p>Back sometime, when I wandered in the cyber space I found a post about <a href="https://80.lv/articles/building-intricate-ice-shaders/">creating intricate ice in Unity</a>, and I immediately fell in love with the visual patterns. There is an incredibly beautiful image for you to have a feel:</p>

<p>However when I bought the asset to see how it works, I was slightly unsatisfied because most of the patterns are baked in textures. The ices are not actually usable for arbitrary objects except for plane. And they are not transparent. I clearly want a toy with similar breath but has the following traits:</p>

<ol>
  <li>it can reflect lights</li>
  <li>it can refract other objects through it</li>
  <li>it has to be transparent (by axiom 2, right?)</li>
</ol>

<p>And after some research, I had this as my result - which is also the same you will have after the tutorial:</p>

<p>I assume you should be familiar with programming with Unity, thatâ€™s all. <em>:)</em></p>

<p>I will explain everything you need to know in the tutorial and you will see it is so easy, in fact, to create the visual effects and the only boundary to use the rest is your imagination.</p>

<p>If you are more than curious with the content, hereâ€™s a list of quickie keywords:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ray tracing</li>
  <li>compute shader</li>
  <li>fresnel effect</li>
</ul>

<p>Donâ€™t be afraid of the words if you donâ€™t know about them! They are really, really simple to understand.</p>
