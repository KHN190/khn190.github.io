Lingxiao (凌霄), graduated with a Computer Science B.S. in 2017, he worked a few years as a software engineer in Beijing and moved a lot in China. During that time, he felt the drive to seek something new - more connected to people, something more expressive. So in 2020 he started a M.S. for Game Design and Developement in [RIT](https://www.rit.edu). 

Later after he moved to New York City and started writing poems, he found game industry doesn't provide all he wanted neither. He wanted to extend the digital medium first and then got a chance into art, after his first exhibition of poetry in Brooklyn. 

Now he creates poetry, video games, wood carvings and reinvents programming languages, the same way Szymborska had worked.

He loves nature, adventural activities, and practices living spiritually.
