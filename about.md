I'm an un-experienced engineer living in China. Guess that's why I frequently run into more build failures than others. I do freelancing to make a living, and principally code in Python and Ruby. But also some Latex and C. Currently I'm [learning Common Lisp](https://github.com/KHN190/puzzle) in some hard way.

I tried to be academic in university, here is a [failed example](https://github.com/KHN190/torch-rnn).

This blog is about some struggles I encountered during my job. Have fun.

你好，生而不幸，（我猜想在看我博客的你十有八九也）成为了一个程序员。

这个博客是关于我在这个行当上遇到的一些挫折。希望你阅读愉快。
