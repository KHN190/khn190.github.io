I'm an un-experienced engineer living in China. Guess that's why I frequently run into more build failures than others. I do freelancing to make a living, and principally code in Python and Ruby (update 2017-05: now Java).

I tried to be academic in university, here is a [failed example](https://github.com/KHN190/torch-rnn).

Now I'm working on AI in Easemob, Beijing. This blog is about some struggles I encountered during my job. Have fun.
