I'm an un-experienced engineer living in China. I do freelancing to make a living, and principally I code in Python and Ruby. But also some Latex and C.

I tried to be academic in university, here is a [failed example](https://github.com/KHN190/torch-rnn).

This blog is about some struggles I encountered during my job. Have fun.
