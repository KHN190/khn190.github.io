Lingxiao (凌霄). Graduated with a Computer Science B.S. in 2017, I worked a few years as a software engineer in Beijing and moved a lot in China. In 2020, during pandemic lockdown I started my Game Design and Developement M.S. in Rochester Institute of Technology. I resided myself in NYC with friends. During this time, I both write poetry and reinvent programming languages, the same way Szymborska has worked.

I'm on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/knh190/).
