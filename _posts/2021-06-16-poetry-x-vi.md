<br>

沒有什麼是需要見證的。

沈默不需要見證。

我不需要見證。

一切的進行也不需要見證。

<br>

來玩一個遊戲。

當我說「沈默」，你保持沈默。——沈默。

你面對著我。沈默。

你的眼睛中，鏡像倍增著。沈默。

時間裡的所有時鐘，已製造和未製造的，

都在生長。沈默。

十年後，有人走過了這扇門。沈默。

它告訴了我很多。可是，

它也永遠不揭露任何答案。沈默。

不要出聲地說出你想說的，然後。沈默。

如果你已清楚地聽到了它。沈默。

<br>

不要，見證。

Nothing needs to be witnessed.

Silence doesn't need a witness.

I don't need a witness.

Everything ongoing doesn't need a witness.

<br>

Let's play a game.

When I say "silence", you keep silence. Silence.

You're facing at me. Silence.

In your eyes, mirrors are doubling. Silence.

All clocks in all the time, the made and haven't been made,

They are clicking. Silence.

After ten years, someone went through the door. Silence.

It has told me much, but also,

It never reveals me any answer. Silence.

Speak out what you want to speak,

Without moving your lips. And, silence.

If you have clearly heard the unheard. Silence.

<br>

Don't, witness.
