<br>

在你肉桂色的夢裡，

你禮貌地問能否開張到你回來。

那個店主等了，

但你隨後忘了。

你再也沒有拜訪過那間雜貨店——

它還開著，只為你開著，但你

再也找不到進入那個夢的路了。

<br>

In your cinnamon dream,

you politely asked the shop to wait until you return.

The shopkeeper waited,

but you forgot it after then.

You never revisited the grocery store - 

It's still opening, only for you, but you

can find an entry to the same dream no more.
