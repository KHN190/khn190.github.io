我試圖成為

我無法想像的一切，

並從中獲得自由。

我無法想像群山，

直到我打破無邊沉默。

我無法想像陣鳥，

直到我安然進入天空。

我無法想像悲傷，

直到我匯聚成為悲傷。

I try to become

The things I can't imagine,

And set free from them.

I couldn't imagine the mountains,

Until I broke the endless silence.

I couldn't imagine the flocks,

Until I entered the sky in tranquility.

I couldn't imagine the sorrow,

Until I became a pool of sorrow.
