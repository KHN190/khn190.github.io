<br>

我试图成为

我无法想象的一切，

并从中获得自由。

我无法想象群山，

直到我打破无边沉默。

我无法想象阵鸟，

直到我安然进入天空。

我无法想象悲伤，

直到我汇聚成为悲伤。

I try to become

The things I can't imagine,

And set free from them.

I couldn't imagine the mountains,

Until I broke the endless silence.

I couldn't imagine the flocks,

Until I entered the sky in tranquility.

I couldn't imagine the sorrow,

Until I became a pool of sorrow.
