<br>

他們從蠻荒裡來，

帶來關於世界的第一本

史集，

早在文明人發現新大陸之前。

傳說他們渴血和用顱骨製成的酒杯暢飲，

書裏記錄了兄弟的名字，

寫滿了背叛和懲罰。

什麼是文明，

是咖啡館裡談論的東西，

還是課堂上教給的。

<br>

他們說我是蠻荒的一部分，

他們檢查了我的染色體。

They came from a savage land,

Bringing the first book about this world -

The Jami' al-Tawarikh,

Long before New World was found by civilized men.

There're tales they are thristy for blood with cups made of human skulls.

There're names of blood brothers and kinships.

There're stories of betrayals and punishments.

What defines civilization?

Is it what we talk about in a coffee shop,

Or what is taught in a class?

<br>

They say I'm a part of their savageness.

They have checked my chromosome.
