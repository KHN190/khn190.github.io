**What is an undertale-like game - A literature perspective**

- Alfred Hitchcock said mystery is not knowing what will happen to a bunch of guys playing poker; suspense is when only you know there’s a bomb underneath the poker table. Write about a banal event, but start by introducing something that will change everything and only the reader knows is coming. —— _642 things to write about_

Raymond Queneau's "**Practices in Style**" told a same story in 99 different ways: there was a young man in a bus, who has a strange long neck. And at the afternoon the writer saw him again at nearby, and the young man's with one of his friends. They discussed a button on his collar.

The same idea applies to game design as well: how would you break the routine that players follow? It could be mechanic, visual, acoustic or about the story. The point is to create innovative feeling by breaking the rules in people's mind. The story may not be important (by Raymond's view)!

**Undertale** heavily used the stereotypes. For example it tells players that "Lv" is required to survive the underground world and this space is dangerous. So the first time when player meets Toriel, one may be suspicious: is there a conspiracy beneth? 

Another example comes in the early game, when player is asked to push a box to pass spikes. Players may think it's easy - especially when the first 2 boxes are fine but unexpectedly the 3rd box talks! And it even runs away as itself wishes. Stereotypes for RPG game doesn't make sense in **Undertale** and if you've killed monsters, there'd be a bad ending.

The trick is first to build an inertial thought, and at some point break the belief that player has built before. **Undertale** is an extraordinary example. Whereas **Salinger** and **Hitchcock** also heavily make use of the tricks in their writings. The trick does not only applies to sensuous operations - trick players like what you do in **Rogue Legacy** - and it can be made to a core mechanism (the 4th wall).
