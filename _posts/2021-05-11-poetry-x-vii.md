这一生

要和多少人告别：

那天在地下室，我们

静悄悄杀死一个孩子，

又埋下一颗

留给未来的核弹。

一个在错误的时间，

仓促到来、又仓促离去的，

就是我们给未来的礼物吗？

我们到底是怎样的人？

In our lives,

how many farewells need to say?

On that day down in the basement,

we silently killed a child, and we

buried an atomic bomb for people unborn.

The day at the wrong time, it

rushed to come, and rushed to leave - 

Is that our present for the future?

After all, what kind of people are we?
