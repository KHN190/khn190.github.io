這一生

要和多少人告別：

那天在地下室，我們

靜悄悄殺死一個孩子，

又埋下一颗

留給未來的原子弹。

一個在錯誤的時間，

倉促到來、又倉促離開的，

就是我們给未來的禮物吗？

我們到底是怎樣的人？

In our lives,

how many farewells need to say?

On that day down in the basement,

we silently killed a child, and we

buried an atomic bomb for people unborn.

The day at the wrong time, it

rushed to come, and rushed to leave - 

Is that our present for the future?

After all, what kind of people are we?
