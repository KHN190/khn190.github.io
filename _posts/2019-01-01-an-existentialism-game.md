> *An Existentialism Game - How to make decisions harder?*

I have recently finished reading a short biographic book about Existentialism. Two things surprised me: one is that though Sartre and Beauvoir were active on politics since 1930s, they were completely blind about the crisis of the rising of Nazi. The other is that the bad situation of American blacks in 1940s to 1950s still surprised French travellers. And in a short 20-30 years, the public idea about racist reversed. How easy is it to form culture? It's an interesting topic.

And back to the title, I have always been thinking about "meaningful choices" in games, and what meaning a game may express. So, what is Existentialism? Existentialism is so different from other philosophies - when other philosophies focus on abstract ideas, it returned to investigate "how do we live"? The way of living, is about personal courage, obligation and morality. I feel this is what I want to create: an existentialism game.

Existentialism inherited from Heidegger's philosophy, and was born in 1930s' France. That generation faced the most serious problem: living. The problem did not only involve with themselves but also the two world wars and a nuclear war threatened the existence of human as a whole. In that situation, what Existentialism provokes were extremely important:

1. A human cannot avoid choices, even making no choice is a choice
2. Every decision is important, because it comes in hand with responsibility
3. Nothing (like God) may give your life meaning, except for your active actions

Above all, Sartre concludes: Existence precedes essence. But the conclusion is too abstract, especially for a game! A game requires something more doable. Is it possible to manifest abstract philosophy in a game? I think it is. The first came to my mind was an opinion from Camus. Camus was born in Algiers, and after the second world war Algeria wanted indepence from France. Then they were in war. Camus said: People are now planting bombs in the tramways of Algiers. My mother might be on one of those tramways. If that is justice, then I prefer my mother. Based on that, here comes my first rule:

* Rule 1: to make decisions harder, you must give both options sufficient reasons and sufficient faults - in fact, you should be crafting a dilemma. And it is obligated for a player to make a choice, and each chioce leads to a responsible result.

This rule is actually common in games. Like in _Life is Strange_ you must choose to sacrifice Chloe or Arcadia Bay, and it is an obvious variation of this dilemma. In communities many players reporting not willing to make the choice again because it is too hard. I think it's a great example of Existentialism question. However, to make players confirmly feel the choice is in their hands, one thing more should be guaranteed:

* Rule 2: a player's choice must have impact on the following stories and even ending.

In _This War of Mine_, players almost face a dilemma every ten minutes: will you take away other people's supplies, steal from them, and even commit a murder, or will you give up the precious medicines and foods to make your life harder? And almost every decision causes a consequence. The consequences must feedback to players clear enough for understanding the burden of choice.

The third investigation	comes from the background of Existentialism. In detail, Existentialism talks about **personal** moralities, but in a speicial society, everyone is obligated to greater responsibility. Will you support Nazi? Will you support atomic bomb experiments, then hydrogen bomb? Will you support racist? It is, that personal morality shall be checked in a social situation. And your personal choice will not only affect yourself but more people. At this time, will you insist on your faith? In this way of thinking, the precedence work of _This War of Mine_ - _Frostpunk_ - probably can be improved: the player still holds an individual perspective, but feedback comes from social level. For example, your daughter was dying from freezing, and as a father you stole medicines from health pot; while a few days later an unexpected plague got prevalent and killed some innocent people because of medicine shortage. The managers investigated, and enacted extreme conservative policies to rein the people, which makes the living situation actually worse. If _This War of Mine_ has a post-war judgement - either judge the player, or the war criminal who flamed the conflicts - I think the feedback of choice will be clearer and more interesting. _Papers, Please_ also has some interesting ideas but the design does not focus on the consequence of decisions. Above all, my third point of view is:

* Rule 3: examine personal choice to social level.

And finally I think there is a supportive mechanic that we can tell players the consequences in advance to fully understance the decisions, and they should be given adequate time to make decision. When consequences were not well understood, actually a choice can be easily made - even randomly, if no information was given. But understanding means unavoidable obligation. Again, in _Life is Strange_, I think Max's ability of reversing time is an excellent design. A similar result may be acieved using a long enough process to ensure investigation is thoroughly processed, somethig like a year-long judicial debate. So my last rule is:

* Rule 4: ensure players understand consequences of different decisions, and give adequat time for the decision.
