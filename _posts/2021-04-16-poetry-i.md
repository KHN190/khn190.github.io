<br>

我再次走进那条河流。

你昨天的梦里在想什么？

暂停。

如果你变成一只鸟，你想变成什么？

暂停。

如果有一所时间停止的永恒宫殿，

它会在哪里？

暂停。

如果死神的晚餐邀请了你，

你准备怎样的盛装？

暂停。

<br>

我昨天在梦里梦见了伤口。

如果我变成鸟，我会是一只猛禽。

如果有一所宫殿，它在一个瞬间里。

如果有一场晚宴，我还有未竟的事情。

<br>

我可以试着告诉你我的答案。

我再次走进那条河流。

I stepped into the river again.

What did you dream about yesterday night?

Stop.

If you'll become a bird, what would you want to be?

Stop.

If there is an eternal palace that pauses time,

where would it be?

Stop.

If death invites you for a dinner,

what kind of dressing would you prepare?

Stop.

<br>

I dreamt about a cut yesterday.

If I become a bird, I'll be a raptor.

If there's a palace, it'll exist in an instant.

If there's a dinner, I have fates incomplete.

<br>

I can only try to tell you my answers.

I stepped into the river again.
