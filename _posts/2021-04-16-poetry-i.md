<br>

我再次走進那條河流。

你昨天的夢裡在想什麼？

暫停。

如果你變成一隻鳥，你想變成什麼？

暫停。

如果有一所時間停止wozaic永恆宮殿，

它會在哪裡？

暫停。

如果死神的晚餐邀請了你，

你準備怎樣的盛裝？

暫停。

<br>

我昨天在夢裡夢見了傷口。

如果我變成鳥，我會是一隻猛禽。

如果有一所宮殿，它在一個瞬間裡。

如果有一場晚宴，我還有未竟的事情。

<br>

我可以試著告訴你我的答案。

我再次走進那條河流。

I stepped into the river again.

What did you dream about yesterday night?

Stop.

If you'll become a bird, what would you want to be?

Stop.

If there is an eternal palace that pauses time,

where would it be?

Stop.

If death invites you for a dinner,

what kind of dressing would you prepare?

Stop.

<br>

I dreamt about a cut yesterday.

If I become a bird, I'll be a raptor.

If there's a palace, it'll exist in an instant.

If there's a dinner, I have fates incomplete.

<br>

I can only try to tell you my answers.

I stepped into the river again.
