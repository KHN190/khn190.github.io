**PICOWARE** is a [mini game jam](https://itch.io/jam/picoware) lasted for one day, with 60+ people submitting their 3-seconds games compiled into one collection. I worked with my friend Maciej Szczerba hosting the jam and contributed 2 mini games + pixel art.

Playable at [Pico-8 BBS](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=34751).
