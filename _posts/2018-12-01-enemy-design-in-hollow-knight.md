> **This is a series of writings on game design. I will review some of my favorites: [The Binding of Isaac](), [Hollow Knight]() and [Donut County]() to explore different mechanics used in these games. Previous post on [The Binding of Isaac is here](https://khn190.github.io/game-design/2018/11/14/enemy-design-in-binding-of-issac.html).**

## Player Actions

Have a look at player actions for Hollow Knight, there are 3 branches:

1. normal attack (and defend)
2. spell attack (and heal)
3. focus attack

With each has a few more:

1. normal attack:
	* can knock back (enemies & some attacks)
	* hit up (for flying enemies)
	* hit down (for spikes and shielded enemies)
2. spell attack:
	* shockwave (for general), Lv1 & Lv2
	* howling wraith (for flying enemies), Lv1 & Lv2
	* sprint, Lv1 & Lv2
	* dive, Lv1 & Lv2
3. [focus attack](http://hollowknight.wikia.com/wiki/Nail):
	* dash hit
	* heavy hit
	* cyclone hit

Considering movements:

1. can jump on walls
2. can fly for a short height
3. superdash

Compared to cheaply created Isaac Rebirth player actions, that's a lot. If the magic for Isaac is randomness (how well a player play with probabilities), Hollow Knight is a harsh test for player's mastery of responsiveness.

Due to the simplicity of actions in Isaac Rebirth, the best strategy for it is gambling. The better tradeoff among items, blood, coins you play, the greater chance you unlock achievements. Obviously, each of these is actually about probability: a donation machine, a gambling machine, an oracle machine, a blood donation machine and a beggar. How much would you like to pay? And how much will you expect to reward? Will you roll a dice? And will you bomb for a secret room? 

I played much better in Isaac Rebirth than 3 years ago. That's not because I mastered actions - I still die 100 times in a normal difficulty action game - but I realized a better strategy for gambling. It's no surprise that next Isaac game will be a card game, since they share the same core mechanism.

For Hollow Knight, there's no uncertainty.

## Enemy behaviours

I can't enumerate enemy behaviours for Hollow Knight. They are so different!

The insects and underground residents really lived like in an eco system with each of them having a characteristic. The mushrooms spread spores, the creatures hide themselves in Greenpath, and the mantises move gracefully with their deadly sickles. In a result, Hollow Knight creates better "immersiveness" because a player does not need to care about pays and rewards, which can only be measured under probabilities.

Abundunce of actions and behaviours is common in action games. Like [Guacamelee](https://store.steampowered.com/app/275390/Guacamelee_Super_Turbo_Championship_Edition/) or [Momodora](https://store.steampowered.com/app/428550/Momodora_Reverie_Under_The_Moonlight/), there are usually combos or combinations of actions to deal greater damage and dodge enemy attacks. Mastery of actions will tell apart the top 1% players from the rest. If an action game does not provide a number of - let's say, 4 actions is ok, and 6 or more will be good - usable abilities, it will fail (the worst I can think of is [this game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/323580/Jotun_Valhalla_Edition/), it only provides 2 attacks and a dodge, making it as boring as hell).

But not many games made it as great as Hollow Knight. The diversity of enemy behaviours makes the game great. And each boss has totally different traits. The most impressive boss in my mind is the [Grimm](http://hollowknight.wikia.com/wiki/Grimm). If you look at him carefully enough, you may see he's able to fool the player with a fake action, and you'll waste an attack.

So except for "immersiveness", Hollow Knight is much harder to master than Isaac Rebirth. Both caused by the great diversity of enemies.

## Hollow Knight is more delicate

I still prefer Hollow Knight over Isaac Rebirth despite they are different games. Isaac Rebirth created 300+ items using "copy and variate", which is cheap. We can shrink that to 1/10 size of what this game now has with little harm to its core machanism - it will still be fun.

However, if you delete any part of maps in Hollow Knight...won't you do that? Each area provides a unique experience that I don't want any of them missing. And they are parts of the greater puzzle of the underlying story. This makes Hollow Knight as one of my favorite games, for ever.
