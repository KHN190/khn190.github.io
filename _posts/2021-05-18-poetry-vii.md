<br>

睡眠是一枚硬幣，

失眠的人重複將它放進售貨機，

並企圖得到意義。

父輩在一面刻下謀殺的暴行，

我不過用一生來醫治

另一面，被生下的罪孽。

<br>

你說，願意和一個人一起生活。

出於怎樣的原因，

才將自己的性命相託？

你說，陌生的詞語：母親。

你不止許諾了自己。

為了推遲一場離別，

人類重複練習歷史的記憶。

<br>

歷史書不能教會我，

要怎麼書寫還沒有寫下的一生。

只是如履薄冰地走著，

只是盡我所能地活著。

還沒有好好當過小孩子的人，

轉眼就成了大人。

Sleep itself is a token.

Insomniacs repeatedly put it into a vending machine,

in hope of trading for some meaning.

Fathers made murders on one side,

I just use my whole life to cure

the sin of being born, on the other side.

<br>

You say, you'd like to live with each other,

for what reasons,

you are stacking your life on top of another?

You say, an estranged word: mother.

You promised more than yourself.

To put off an eternal farewell,

human would pratice recalling history, again and again.

<br>

History books don't tell me

what to write for what hasn't been the past.

I just walk on thin ice.

I just live as I can.

The one who has never been a kid

has been a fully-grown, in a flip.
