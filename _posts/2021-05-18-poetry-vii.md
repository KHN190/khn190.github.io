<br>

睡眠是一枚硬币，

失眠的人重复将它放进售货机，

并企图得到意义。

父辈在一面刻下谋杀的暴行，

我不过用一生来医治

另一面，被生下的罪孽。

<br>

你说，愿意和一个人一起生活。

出于怎样的原因，

才将自己的性命相托？

你说，陌生的词语：母亲。

你不止许诺了自己。

为了推迟一场离别，

人类重复练习历史的记忆。

<br>

历史书不能教会我，

要怎么书写还没有写下的一生。

只是如履薄冰地走着，

只是尽我所能地活着。

还没有好好当过小孩子的人，

转眼就成了大人。

Sleep itself is a token.

Insomniacs repeatedly put it into a vending machine,

in hope of trading for some meaning.

Fathers made murders on one side,

I just use my whole life to cure

the sin of being born, on the other side.

<br>

You say, you'd like to live with each other,

for what reasons,

you are stacking your life on top of another?

You say, an estranged word: mother.

You promised more than yourself.

To put off an eternal farewell,

human would pratice recalling history, again and again.

<br>

History books don't tell me

what to write for what hasn't been the past.

I just walk on thin ice.

I just live as I can.

The one who has never been a kid

has been a fully-grown, in a flip.
