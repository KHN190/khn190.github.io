The plot development of game Celeste is straightly a pre-modern Christian story, with a bite of modern spirit transform. In this game a little girl set off for a trip climbing mountain Celeste; at the beginning we were not told the reason why she’s here, and we do not know what is waiting in front.

On the half of the journey, this little girl met difficult terrains, bad weathers, and someone she tried to help but in return hurt her. She also met the dark side of herself, trying to incite her to give up. But she also made friends, and she got good advise to embrace her fears instead of rejecting herself. As a result, she admitted her tense and fears. The dark side forgave herself and they helped each other finally reach the ascent.

The story should be ended when she has tolerated her deficiencies. The final ascent is just completing the good ending. Sounds sweet for everyone who has concerned that whether they would make it. But wait. Is that all?

They’ve expected there should be something at the end of climbing, but for certain reasons, the game developers lost the part and let it end in the halfway. 

The first problem comes that **why she would go on** if she has successfully got along well with herself? She must has a reason for the urge of ascending. But game didn’t tell us.

How about we put an alternative ending? 

What if the little girl did not forget her aim - she has built her belief during the journey that when she conquered the difficulties, she will be rewarded (what a familiar conviction!). But when she arrived, there was no resurrect, no redeem, no magic, no healing, nor an answer to everything. Let’s say, at the top of the mountain, there was truly empty. **The terrifying thing happened: the nihility**.

This is a real thing that happened to our human culture. When Nietzsche announced: God is dead! The old morals had been dead for long. The only important thing we remember in this story is that the little girl **climbed for a reason**. What’s it? The sweet dream broke when she did not find a key at the top of the mountain. If you may argue: but she's got an insight during the journey, then you’ve catched the interesting point.

In this way, the alternative ending would not simply end, but will intrigue the interest for a player to look out one step further. What have you learned and experienced in this process? And What will you do if your faith has been built and crushed?
