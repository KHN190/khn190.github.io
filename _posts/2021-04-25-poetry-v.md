<br>

我可以告诉你怎样驯服一只猛禽。

它还不能笨拙地回应你的手语。

它是素食和简练的杀手，

它的杀戮不是为了食物。

你的第一个指令，

需要用几乎是命令、要挟和恳求说——

「爱我」。

I can tell you how to tame a raptor.

He can't clumsily respond to your signed language yet.

He is a vegetarian and succinct predator,

He kills not for food.

Your first instruction,

Needs to be almost with commanding, threatening, and begging -

"Love me".
