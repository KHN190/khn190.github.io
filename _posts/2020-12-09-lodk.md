**Light of Darkness** is a very short video game made over a night in December, 2020. The game visualizes several different time scales with virtual installations - a spring, a stellar and a flock of birds - to present the idea that time is a sensible, consistent entity, in contrary to the fractured sense of time in a modern society.
